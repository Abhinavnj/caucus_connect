# caucus_connect

Website built using PHP and Bootstrap to connect Secaucus High School (SHS) students to SHS alumni that are affiliated with their prospective major/school.
Allows students to verify themselves through Google Sign-In and browse through a list of alumni registered in the MySQL database and request the contact information of alumni that match their interests.
Emails with information are sent through PHPMailer & Google's SMTP servers.
